Enabling MathJax
======


This script will enable matchjax which you can use to insert LaTex math
formulae into the page.  Yes, Canvas has a built-in equation editor but it
doesn't support all LaTex markup or multiple lines.  

When MathJax is enabled
on your account, you can insert LaTex markup using one of two delimiters,
either \[ and \] or $$ and $$.

Both of the following lines do the same thing:

  \[ \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right) \]

  $$ \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right) $$

While you do not have to be in the source view to insert a formula, you may
want to verify that the formula is not enclosed by "&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;" tags.  These tags block
MathJax from working properly.


Support
======

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in 
mind. Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this.
That said, the community will hopefully help support and keep
both the script and this documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
